# JS-Assignment
Java Script Assignment

This project filters data from an external javascript table in a list of dictionaries format and reports the results out to a customized website web.  
It filters using D3 forEach and Object to create functions that call out certain variables to filter the data down and aooends it to  dynamically update the data table for the site.

I have complted the first section.  The site is customized with a different photo, and small red ufo. Also am able to do a filtered search of the data table and return only the events for the selected date.

As time allows I will add other filters for object and complete the advanced section.


Thank you, 

Jeff Olson
